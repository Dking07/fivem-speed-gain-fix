### Fix Vehicles Speeds Gain.

## CHANGES

## DOWNLOAD

* [TEBEX](https://dking.tebex.io/package/6562200)

## HOW TO INSTALL

## HOW TO USE

### To work, you need to modify the handlings that you want the script to take effect on.

### Modifications

* Remove the 'fDownforceModifier' line if it exists; (It's not necessary, but I recommend it)
* Add CCarHandlingData in the SubHandlingData section, like this:
    ```
    <SubHandlingData>
        <Item type="CCarHandlingData">
        </Item>
        <Item type="NULL" />
        <Item type="NULL" />
    </SubHandlingData>
    ```

## CONFIG

* ### You can choose which effects will be applied through the configuration file.
