### Modifications

* Remove the 'fDownforceModifier' line if it exists; (It's not necessary, but I recommend it)
* Add CCarHandlingData in the SubHandlingData section, like this:
    ```
    <SubHandlingData>
        <Item type="CCarHandlingData">
        </Item>
        <Item type="NULL" />
        <Item type="NULL" />
    </SubHandlingData>
    ```
